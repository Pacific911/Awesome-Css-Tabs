                <h3>Product Details</h3>
                <p>A good product description should focus on the product's features and benefits. 
                    Obviously, the features are a bit more clear cut. The benefits will require a bit more creativity and understanding of your target audience. 
                    However, both features and benefits allow for creative writing.

                <h3>Returns Info</h3>
                <p>Return policies are the rules a retailer creates to manage how customers return and exchange unwanted merchandise they purchased.
                    A return policy tells customers what items can be returned and for what reasons, 
                    as well as the timeframe over which returns are accepted.
